This account was created for use with my Wake Tech courses in order to keep them separate from my personal account.
This repository was created as part of the first lab for the CTI-110 course during the spring 2025 semester.

## Websites I Recommend

- [The Onion](https://theonion.com/onion-news-network/) - A fun satirical news website that has an uncanny ability to combine over-the-top silliness with a dash of poignancy.
- [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) - An archive serving to host the world's largest fanfiction archive for when you're not quite ready to let go of your beloved characters and their world just yet.
