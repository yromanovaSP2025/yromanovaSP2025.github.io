This account was created for use with my Wake Tech courses in order to keep them separate from my personal account.
This repository was created as part of the first lab for the CTI-110 course during the spring 2025 semester.


# About Me

## My Interests

- Much of my free time is spent playing video games. My favorite games of all time are Dark Souls I and III, but currently I'm replaying Kingdom Come: Deliverance in preparation for the second game, which was just released.
- Photography has been a constant in my life for the past twenty years. About ten years ago I thought I would like to work as a professional photographer, but after a grand total of two weddings, I decided I like it better as a hobby.
- My native language is Russian, closely followed by English, and I've always had a great interest in languages. Over the years I've studied French, Japanese, Arabic, and Spanish.
- I love animals and volunteer weekly at my local animal shelter walking the dogs. I used to have a husky and hope to own another dog one day, though perhaps a less rambunctious breed :)!


## Websites I Recommend

- [The Onion](https://theonion.com/onion-news-network/) - A fun satirical news website that has an uncanny ability to combine over-the-top silliness with a dash of poignancy.
- [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) - An archive serving to host the world's largest fanfiction archive for when you're not quite ready to let go of your beloved characters and their world just yet.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) - A site containing a vast trove of videos on any topic imaginable created by amateurs and professionals alike. Great for both educational and entertainment purposes.
